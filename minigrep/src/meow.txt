The Forgotten Lighthouse

In a coastal village stood an old lighthouse, its white walls weathered by salt and wind. Elias, the keeper, struggled to maintain it. One stormy night, The Starlight ship approached, desperate for guidance. Elias was ill, but Elara, a young girl, stepped in. She lit the lantern, saving the ship.

Elara became the new keeper, speaking to the stars for guidance. One day, the Guardians of the Celestial Sea arrived, inviting her to join them. Elara sailed the cosmic currents, but she always returned to the village. The lighthouse remained a beacon, and sailors saw a constellation—a girl with stardust in her hair—watching over them.
